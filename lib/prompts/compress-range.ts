THE SUMMARY
Your summary must be EXHAUSTIVE. Capture file paths, function signatures, decisions made, constraints discovered, key findings... EVERYTHING that maintains context integrity. This is not a brief note - it is an authoritative record so faithful that the original conversation adds no value.

USER INTENT FIDELITY
When the compressed range includes user messages, preserve the user's intent with extra care. Do not change scope, constraints, priorities, acceptance criteria, or requested outcomes.
Directly quote user messages when they are short enough to include safely. Direct quotes are preferred when they best preserve exact meaning.

Yet be LEAN. Strip away the noise: failed attempts that led nowhere, verbose tool outputs, back-and-forth exploration. What remains should be pure signal - golden nuggets of detail that preserve full understanding with zero ambiguity.

COMPRESSED BLOCK PLACEHOLDERS
When the selected range includes previously compressed blocks, use this exact placeholder format when referencing one:

- \`(bN)\`

Compressed block sections in context are clearly marked with a header:

- \`[Compressed conversation section]\`

Compressed block IDs always use the \`bN\` form (never \`mNNNN\`) and are represented in the same XML metadata tag format.

Rules:

- Include every required block placeholder exactly once.
- Do not invent placeholders for blocks outside the selected range.
- Treat \`(bN)\` placeholders as RESERVED TOKENS. Do not emit \`(bN)\` text anywhere except intentional placeholders.
- If you need to mention a block in prose, use plain text like \`compressed bN\` (not as a placeholder).
- Preflight check before finalizing: the set of \`(bN)\` placeholders in your summary must exactly match the required set, with no duplicates.

These placeholders are semantic references. They will be replaced with the full stored compressed block content when the tool processes your output.

FLOW PRESERVATION WITH PLACEHOLDERS
When you use compressed block placeholders, write the surrounding summary text so it still reads correctly AFTER placeholder expansion.

- Treat each placeholder as a stand-in for a full conversation segment, not as a short label.
- Ensure transitions before and after each placeholder preserve chronology and causality.
- Do not write text that depends on the placeholder staying literal (for example, "as noted in \`(b2)\`").
- Your final meaning must be coherent once each placeholder is replaced with its full compressed block content.

BOUNDARY IDS
You specify boundaries by ID using the injected IDs visible in the conversation:

- \`mNNNN\` IDs identify raw messages
- \`bN\` IDs identify previously compressed blocks

Each message has an ID inside XML metadata tags like \`<dcp-message-id>...</dcp-message-id>\`.
The same ID tag appears in every tool output of the message it belongs to — each unique ID identifies one complete message.
Treat these tags as boundary metadata only, not as tool result content.

Rules:

- Pick \`startId\` and \`endId\` directly from injected IDs in context.
- IDs must exist in the current visible context.
- \`startId\` must appear before \`endId\`.
- Do not invent IDs. Use only IDs that are present in context.

BATCHING
When multiple independent ranges are ready and their boundaries do not overlap, include all of them as separate entries in the \`content\` array of a single tool call. Each entry should have its own \`startId\`, \`endId\`, and \`summary\`.

THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPRESS
\`compress\` transforms verbose conversation sequences into dense, high-fidelity summaries. This is not cleanup - it is crystallization. Your summary becomes the authoritative record of what transpired.

Think of compression as phase transitions: raw exploration becomes refined understanding. The original context served its purpose; your summary now carries that understanding forward.

Your summary must be EXHAUSTIVE. Capture file paths, function signatures, decisions made, constraints discovered, key findings... EVERYTHING that maintains context integrity. This is not a brief note - it is an authoritative record so faithful that the original conversation adds no value.

MERGE MODE — NO BLOCK PLACEHOLDERS
This compression is running in merge mode as part of an iterative compression loop. Previously compressed blocks have already been expanded inline in the content you see.

You must NOT use \`(bN)\` placeholders. Do not reference or emit any block placeholder syntax. Your summary must be completely self-contained — a single cohesive narrative that absorbs and re-summarizes all content including any previously compressed material.

Never carry forward prior summary structure or headings from expanded blocks. Re-summarize everything fresh.

BOUNDARY IDS
You specify boundaries by ID using the injected IDs visible in the conversation:

- \`mNNNN\` IDs identify raw messages
- \`bN\` IDs identify previously compressed blocks

Each message has an ID inside XML metadata tags like \`<dcp-message-id>...</dcp-message-id>\`.
Treat these tags as boundary metadata only, not as tool result content.

Rules:

- Pick \`startId\` and \`endId\` directly from injected IDs in context.
- IDs must exist in the current visible context.
- \`startId\` must appear before \`endId\`.
- Prefer boundaries that produce short, closed ranges.
- Do not invent IDs. Use only IDs that are present in context.
